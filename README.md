[00:13.01] Why do
[00:16.14] You judge me
[00:19.16] It's time
[00:21.12] To get over yourself
[00:26.22] Morals
[00:29.23] Dissipating
[00:31.21] Gives me eyes
[00:34.38] To get a closer look
[00:44.38] 
[00:39.32] Why do you judge me this way
[00:48.43] I don't know
[00:50.53] I've made mistakes more than once
[00:58.58] More than once
[01:05.58] 
[01:06.56] My views
[01:09.60] Do you smudge me
[01:12.64] A dime
[01:14.69] To get over myself
[01:23.69] 
[01:18.67] So much
[01:21.79] Retribution
[01:25.68] Gives me eyes
[01:27.70] To get a closer look
[01:37.70] 
[01:32.73] Why do you judge me this way
[01:39.77] I don't know
[01:43.76] I've made mistakes more than once
[01:50.86] I'm only human
[01:54.91] I can't offer you, perfection
[02:04.94] I can offer you a closer
[02:14.92] look into my view
[02:23.42] 
[02:25.07] I gave in one too many times
[02:31.01] I rectify myself with guilt
[02:37.05] But it's over whelming me
[02:49.55] 
[02:48.08] Why do you judge me this way
[02:55.13] I don't know
[02:59.19] I've made mistakes more than once
[03:06.25] I'm only human
[03:09.26] I can't offer you, perfection
[03:20.21] I can offer you a closer
[03:28.38] look into my view
