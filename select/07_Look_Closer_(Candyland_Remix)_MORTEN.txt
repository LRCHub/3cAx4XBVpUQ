"Look Closer"

We are intent only on our own gain.

Tune in and avert your eyes to the blank telescreen.
They're watching you sleep, telling you to eat
What could be soylent green.
Now, now, now look away and go back to bed.
They will get what they need
When we sleep, work, and play,
When we consume and obey.

'Cause we are all born in to a controlled mindset.
Godmoney makes a death threat on ethics.
Governed by greed and a stale routine.
Can we just justify the means if we're...

Plugged in, tuned out?
We all need to wake up 'cause we've been
Detached for too long.
We need to deprogram from
Shifting with the public eye.
We have a right to question why.
See through the lies,
Re-sensitize, and look closer.

Get schooled, get married, get it on.
Start a family. Hurry, move along.
You might start to think, make a different move.
Lose your only mind that you've never used anyway.
Walk on the white line. Brainwashed.
Walk on the same side. Brain dead.
It's secure and safe like you need it all to be.

Plugged in, tuned out
We all need to wake up 'cause we've been
Detached for too long.
We need to deprogram from
Shifting with the public eye.
We have a right to question why.
See through the lies,
Re-sensitize, and look closer.

And look closer in.
(They live) wide awake, fully aware,
(We sleep) on a quest to find out where
(They live) the dream turned into a scare,
(We sleep) a fascinating new nightmare.
(They live) wide awake, fully aware,
(We sleep) on a quest to find out where
(They live) the dream turned into a scare,
(We sleep) a fascinating new nightmare.

Walk on the white line. Brainwashed.
Walk on the same side. Brain dead.
It's secure and safe like you need it all...

They want benign complacency.
This is where we start to look closer.

Plugged in, tuned out, wake up.
Plugged in, tuned out, wake up.
Plugged in, tuned out
We all need to wake up 'cause we've been
Detached for too long.
We need to deprogram from
Shifting with the public eye.
We have a right to question why.
See through the lies,
Re-sensitize, and look closer.

Now, now look closer.
